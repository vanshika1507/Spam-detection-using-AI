# Spam-detection-using-AI
Our problem statement is based on the theme AI in Spam Detection and deals with how the mails we receive are classified as spam or not and prevents important mails to be reported spam. So, we feel that the solution to this problem can be a proper analysis from the spam reporter involving specific questions pointing towards what words or sentences made them question the senderâ€™s intent to be able to categorize emails correctly. This would be carried out via simple code. The task is to classify the e-mails as spam or non-spam; hence we'll be using the classification model. We here use Naive Bayes as it works better for models performing text classification task.
